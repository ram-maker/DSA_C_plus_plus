Essence of Design Patterns in software developemnt

In ever evolving field of software developemnt it's not true that the class that you have defined remain unmodified, a modification is required as per
the requirements, so if a modicitaion is done directly to the concrete class so as to fullfill the requirements, its fine, but waht if that class has codespace that depends on them
Now here we come the modification done to fullfill for the requirements A , will have chance of yielding error for codespaceB,codespaceC. Its no matter of time that
your entire software projects gets messed up. Thus a design pattern helps to solve this problem.

Loose Coupling
One solution to this is to introduce loose coupling between the object and its concreteclass. Coupling of object is nothing but a its level of dependence on its class.
Its always to have loose coupling between the object and its concrete class,If object depeends heavily on concrete class, a slight modification would result in 
massive chaos.

Dispatch:
In object-oriented programming, dispatch is the process of figuring out which method to call when we run a program. Imagine you have a method called makeSound()
 in different animal classes, like Dog and Cat. When you call makeSound() on an animal object, dispatching decides whether you 
get a “bark” or a “meow” at runtime, depending on whether the object is a Dog or a Cat.
